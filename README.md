# Hate Speech Detection on Twitter Using NLP

This project explores the detection of hate speech from tweets using various machine learning and deep learning models, including transformers. It was completed as part of an internship at IIT Indore under the mentorship of Dr. Nagendra Kumar.

## üìù Project Summary

- **Dataset**: Kaggle Twitter Hate Speech Dataset (binary classification: hate vs. non-hate)
- **Techniques**: Classical ML (Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression), Deep Learning (MLP, LSTM, BiLSTM), Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa, MPNet, T5, Electra)
- **Embeddings**: CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, BERT, MPNet, etc.
- **Sampling**: SMOTE, Undersampling
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, scikit-learn
